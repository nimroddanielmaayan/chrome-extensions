## Chrome Extension Basics

- Every Chrome extention needs to have a `manifest.json` file

- Most extensions need access to one or more Chrome Extensions APIs. An
  Extensions API consists of a namespace containing methods and properties for
  doing extensions work, and usually, but not always, manifest fields for the
  manifest.json file

- In order to develop and test extensions, we can use the `development mode` in
  chrome://extensions

- It's only neccessary to reload our extension if we changed the `manifest.json`
  file, or if we want to do a fresh reload for testing purposes
